1. Approach1: Recursion + Memoization
*  Results in Time limit exceed.
*  Time complexity is O(m * n) -> m is maximum element in the array, n is size of array.
*  because each time we iterate from 1 to value of element in the posisition.
​
2. Approach2: Greedy
* Hint: can we record the maximum reachable distance and understand anything?
*  watch Techdose video for better understanding - O(n)
